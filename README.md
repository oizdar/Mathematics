# Mathematics

In this repository I will try to resolve different popular mathematic problems and tasks. 
e.g. Matrices, Fibonacci, Sorting etc. I also try to do Unit tests for all classes.

Below List of recently resolved:

* Matrices - creating and all posible operations using Matrix Object.
* Static class with various operations:
	* Mertens Function
	* Mobius Function (needed for Mertens)
	* Reverse Polish notation Calulator - I assumed string is properly formatted (between each operator and operand are one or more space, with suitable number of elements and order)
