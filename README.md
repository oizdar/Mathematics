In this repository I will try to resolve different popular mathematic problems and tasks. 
e.g. Matrices, Fibonacci, Sorting etc. I also try to do Unit tests for all classes.

Below List of recently resolved:

* Matrices - creating and all posible operations.
* Static class with various operations:
	* Mertens Function
	* Mobius Function (needed for Mertens)
